### Assalam-O-Alikum! üôÇ

I am a Software Engineer and a goal-driven developer. My experience of working with a startup for almost one year has taught me that despite the ever-changing dynamics of business drivers, the only impossible goal is the one we abandon too soon. With faith in The Lord of the Worlds and a commitment to continuous learning, I strive to be among the top 1% in my field.  

I am driven by the desire to create impactful solutions and deliver satisfaction and excellence in every project I undertake. Whether it's writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code or tackling the complex challenges of transforming ideas into MVPs that can thrive in the market, I believe in staying consistent, patient, and focused on the end goal.
